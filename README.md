## Master Project in Financial Mathematics, EPFL
# Princing TARN Using Numerical Methods
The goal of this project is to find some efficient numerical methods in order to price Target Accrual Redemption Notes (TARN).
For the moment we have implemented the Monte Carlo and Finite Difference method on a Black-Scholes model with constant paramters.

However there is a problem with a special case, called No Gain Knock-Out condition, for the FD method. The problem seems to be in the diffusion of the process.

The next step is to find other methods, more efficient than these ones if possible and to extend them to more complex models as Local Volatility or Stochastic Volatility models.
